<p class="ph2">A DAUGHTER OF JAPAN</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>is laying the table for breakfast. He is looking
very solemn. A bell rings. He starts and looks
nervously over his shoulder at the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Lieut.-Commander
Belson</span> <i>appears in the doorway</i>.
<span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>takes a few steps towards him, salutes, and
then stands at &#8220;attention.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>in a hard, quarterdeck voice</i>). Is that you,
Simpson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>coming into the room</i>). Where is Mr.
Maitland?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Gone riding, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> When do you expect him back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> To breakfast, sir. About half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>looking</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>up and down</i>). You&#8217;re
a bright beauty, aren&#8217;t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>moving his feet awkwardly</i>). You don&#8217;t
know what I&#8217;ve been through, sir. I did all a man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>sharply</i>). Oh, yes, I know.... When
you sent that letter to the Captain saying where we
could find Mr. Maitland&mdash;and you, why didn&#8217;t you
explain why he was hiding away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Well, sir, his business is no business
of mine. I done all I could to get him back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
ship, sir, but he wouldn&#8217;t listen to me, sir. He said
he&#8217;d stop and marry her if the Navy went to the
bottom for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Marry her! Marry whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> The little Japanese lady, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>startled, shouting</i>). The what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>very uncomfortably</i>). The little Japanese
lady, sir. Miss Ometsu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>more startled</i>). And who the devil&#8217;s she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> She&#8217;s the daughter of a Japanese naval
officer, sir. He was killed in the war. Her brother&#8217;s
in the service too, sir. She talks just like you and
me, sir. She lives here with her mother, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>draws back and again looks</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>up
and down</i>). The deuce she does! Then Mr. Maitland
is a guest here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> How long has this been going on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Oh, for a long time, sir; nearly a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> And do you tell me that Mr. Maitland
is going to <i>marry</i> this Japanese lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir. That&#8217;s why I wrote, sir.
I didn&#8217;t want him to leave the Navy, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>grunts</i>). And what about yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> I don&#8217;t want to leave it neither, sir.
I&#8217;ve got fifteen years&#8217; service and I should like to
earn a pension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> I should think you&#8217;re more likely to
earn six months for desertion. Do you know that
you are absent from the ship now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>in agony</i>). Not until to-night, sir, is it?
I thought there&#8217;d be time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> I don&#8217;t want to know what you thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Why didn&#8217;t you write before&mdash;when you knew what
he meant to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> I &#8217;oped against &#8217;ope, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> You hoped! And what were you
stopping for? Were you to marry a Japanese, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>putting out his hands</i>). No, sir, no. I
don&#8217;t hold with it, sir. But she&#8217;s a sweet little thing,
sir, and I know she&#8217;s very fond of him. It makes
me real bad to think what&#8217;ll happen when they see
you, sir. I think he&#8217;ll half-kill me. (<i>Turning away.</i>)
I wish we&#8217;d never come to Japan!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>looking round the room</i>). And where are
the ladies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> They&#8217;ll be down to breakfast in a
minute, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>immediately uneasy</i>). Well, I&#8217;ll go and
meet Mr. Maitland, and you&#8217;d better get ready to
come back at once. We&#8217;ve no time to lose if we&#8217;re
to catch the ship. (<i>Turns to go out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> When does she sail, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> To-morrow morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>gasping</i>). For home, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>going out</i>). Yes.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<blockquote>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>shows signs of perturbation, and wipes his
face with his handkerchief. He looks in a half-dazed
way round the room, and then goes to the table
to complete preparations for breakfast. Through
the curtained doorway on right</i>, <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> <i>appears,
dressed in a charming Japanese costume, with
satin slippers to match her robe</i>.)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Good-morning, Simpson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Good-morning, miss.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>going to table</i>). Mother is not coming
down to breakfast, Simpson. So there&#8217;ll only be
Mr. Maitland and me. (<i>Skips.</i>) Isn&#8217;t it lovely.
Has he gone riding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>still fooling about the table</i>). Yes, miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> And he will be back quite soon, won&#8217;t
he, Simpson? It always seems so long when he&#8217;s
away. (<i>She runs to the door and looks out.</i>) It&#8217;s
heavenly, and to-day! I am so happy to-day.
(<i>Goes to table and looks up at</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span>.) Do you know
what to-day is, Simpson? It&#8217;s my birthday! I&#8217;m
seventeen&mdash;quite a woman now, and next week at this
time I shall be Mrs. Maitland, and you&#8217;ll be calling
me mam! (<i>She gives a happy little laugh.</i>) Aren&#8217;t
you going to wish me many happy returns, Simpson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>turns to her sadly, tries to speak, shakes
his head and turns away</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>in a tone of anxiety</i>). Why, what&#8217;s the
matter? Are you not well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>pulls himself together</i>). Yes, miss....
No, I don&#8217;t think I am, miss. I don&#8217;t know. Something&#8217;s
come over me which makes me feel quite
bad. I don&#8217;t think this climate quite suits me, miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Not suit you? Why, you&#8217;ve always
been quite well until now. It can&#8217;t be the climate.
(<i>Anxiously.</i>) Would you like a little brandy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Yes, yes, please, miss. (<i>He
sinks into a chair while she runs to the sideboard and
pours him out a peg.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>brings the brandy</i>). There! I am so
sorry, I wonder what&#8217;s brought this on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>gulps down the brandy</i>). Thank ye,
miss. I shall be better now. (<i>He gets up and takes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<i>the glass to the sideboard and then turns.</i>) Do you
know, miss&mdash;&mdash;Your father was a sailor, wasn&#8217;t
he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>wonderingly</i>). Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> In your Navy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> And he was an officer, wasn&#8217;t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Yes, a commander&mdash;but why&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> And he was killed in the war, wasn&#8217;t
he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>nods her head</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Well, wouldn&#8217;t you like Mr. Maitland
to go and do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>eyes wide with terror</i>). Mr. Maitland ...
killed.... Has something happened?... Oh,
what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>alarmed at her being alarmed</i>). No, no,
I don&#8217;t mean that, miss; I don&#8217;t mean that. I
mean&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Blows his cheeks out.</i>) I don&#8217;t know what
I mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>coming to him</i>). Simpson, what <i>do</i> you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>with supreme effort</i>). Well, miss, I mean
Once a Sailor always a Sailor! (<i>He draws back
as if he had explained everything.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Oh, is that all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> All? Why, miss, it&#8217;s everything. Mr.
Maitland can never help being a sailor now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>laughs with relief</i>). You funny man,
Simpson. You make such a lot out of nothing. Of
course Mr. Maitland&#8217;s a sailor. Isn&#8217;t he going to
take me&mdash;and you&mdash;for a long cruise among the
South Sea Islands? We shall be perfectly happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
down there, Simpson. You will get rid of all your
troubles then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>groans, looks at her and shakes his head</i>).
I don&#8217;t think he ought to leave the Navy, miss. Think
what&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>walks away towards piano</i>). Simpson!
Mr. Maitland has told you that you are not to speak
to me about this. He has quite made up his mind,
and you have promised to leave the service too and
come with us. Surely Mr. Maitland has offered you
sufficient&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, miss, yes, but it isn&#8217;t that. It
isn&#8217;t my pension I&#8217;m thinking about ... but I&#8217;d
like to finish my time with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Oh, Simpson, don&#8217;t be silly.... You will
finish it with him. He&#8217;s going to do ever so much
more for you than your Navy can. And didn&#8217;t he
say you should come to our wedding and be his
best man and sign the register? And when we go
away you will be in charge of everything. Why, you
will be quite a big man; and Jack&mdash;Mr. Maitland,
says we may go pearl-fishing, and you will make
your fortune then.... (<span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>still looks dully at
her</i>.) Oh, you <i>are</i> grumpy this morning. I don&#8217;t
like you a bit. I wish I hadn&#8217;t given you the brandy
now. (<i>Shakes an accusing finger at him.</i>) I think
you&#8217;ve been drinking. (<i>She goes to the piano and
plays a snatch of Mandalay. Almost immediately</i>
<span class="smcap">Maitland&#8217;s</span> <i>voice joins in the song. As he reaches
the doorway she gives a little scream of delight, jumps
off the stool and runs to meet him. He catches her in
his arms.</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>quickly leaves by the door on left</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Sweetheart!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>holding her face to his</i>). Dear&mdash;dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>leading her down and then stopping to kiss
her forehead</i>). Many happy returns, sweetheart
Quite a grown-up, now, aren&#8217;t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>standing on tiptoe</i>). Yes, quite a woman&mdash;look!
(<i>He catches her to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>leading her to chair at table and sits himself</i>).
And what <i>do</i> you think I&#8217;ve got for you? One of
them is wonderful&mdash;I shall give only that one in
my whole lifetime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>looking eagerly at him</i>). Sweetheart!
Tell me! (<i>He takes two packets from his pocket, one
of them is an envelope. He unfolds the small packet
and holds up a bracelet. She gives a little gurgle of
delight and holds out her left wrist. He clasps it,
and then touches a spring. A lid flies open like a watch.
She gives a little scream.</i>) Oh, oh, it&#8217;s your portrait.
Isn&#8217;t it lovely! (<i>She looks at it, and then says, curiously,
as she closes it down.</i>) You darling! And what&#8217;s
the other? I <i>am</i> a lucky girl! (<i>He takes a document
from an envelope, unfolds it and offers it to her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Our marriage license! (<i>Laughs joyously
as she stares at it.</i>) So we can be married next Thursday,
if mother says yes. By the way, where is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> She said she wouldn&#8217;t come down this
morning. She said she knew I&#8217;d like to have breakfast
alone with you to-day. Isn&#8217;t she a dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> She&#8217;s a clinker. Well, we&#8217;ll ask her when
she comes down. But what about some breakfast?
I&#8217;m famished! (<i>Shouts.</i>) Simpson! (<i>Bangs a bell
on the table.</i>) Simpson! (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>.) You
can&#8217;t make love properly when you&#8217;re starving, you
know pettling. Wait till I&#8217;ve had some breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and then&mdash;&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you! (<i>Bangs the bell again
and shouts.</i>) Simpson! Confound the man, what&#8217;s
up with him this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Well, he is funny, dear! He&#8217;s been
on again about your leaving the Navy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>jumps up and bangs the table</i>). I won&#8217;t have
it. I won&#8217;t have it! I&#8217;ll kick him out. He can
go back alone. How dare he talk to you about it
when I told him not to. (<i>Turns to door on left.</i>)
I&#8217;ll let him know if he&#8217;s going to defy orders. (<i>At
the door he meets</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>with breakfast on tray</i>.)
Here, you blackguard, what do you mean by it?
Didn&#8217;t I tell you that I wouldn&#8217;t have you talking to
mam&#8217;zelle about my leaving the Navy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>going towards table and looking straight to
his front</i>). Yes, sir. (<i>Goes on with his work.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>following behind and shouting</i>). Haven&#8217;t I
sent in my papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Haven&#8217;t I sent in the money for your discharge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Didn&#8217;t I say that the Navy could go to the
devil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> And didn&#8217;t I say that I&#8217;d break your
neck if I heard any more about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> And aren&#8217;t you satisfied with my terms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir, of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Then, what do you mean by it? Look
here, Simpson, if you&#8217;re not very careful I&#8217;ll not let
you speak to mam&#8217;zelle at all. (<i>He says this as if</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<i>he had ordered</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>out to instant execution</i>.) I&#8217;m
trying to make everything as nice and comfortable
as I can for you. I&#8217;ve said a lot of nice things to
mam&#8217;zelle about you, and tried to make her like you
too, and this is how you serve me. (<i>Putting down his
fist impressively on the table.</i>) I won&#8217;t have another
word said about the Navy. We&#8217;ve done with it.
Mam&#8217;zelle and I are to be married on Thursday.
(<i>He puts out one hand towards her and she takes it.</i>)
We shall sail for Singapore a day or two after. At
Singapore I shall charter a small vessel, and we shall
go for a long cruise&mdash;and I don&#8217;t know when we
are coming back. Now, Simpson, did you grasp all
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> You&#8217;re quite sure you understand about
the Navy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> No more whining about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> No more lamentations about your fifteen
years&#8217; service?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>sitting</i>). Then serve the breakfast! (<i>During
the conversation at the table</i>, <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>makes two or
three attempts to break in and explain the real cause
of his distress&mdash;but his courage fails each time. He
shows by his manner, also, that the discussion of their
plans causes him acute suffering.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>). Well, little woman,
what shall we do to-day? Something beautiful,
something delightful, wonderful&mdash;because&mdash;you can&#8217;t
have another seventeenth birthday. Shall we go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the lake and have a little picnic all by our two selves?
(<i>She smiles and nods delightedly.</i>) And we&#8217;ll draw
up plans for the wedding. (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span>, <i>who
is waiting on them</i>.) You know, Simpson, I&#8217;d half
made up my mind to let you come and be a witness
at the wedding, but I feel very angry with you just
now. I don&#8217;t think you ought to be near her at
present. I think you&#8217;d better keep out of the way
until after the wedding. (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>.) Would
you like me to keep him out of sight, darling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Oh, no, dear. I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t mean
to make me unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Yes, I know, sweetheart, but he mustn&#8217;t
make these mistakes. Well, I&#8217;ll think about it.
Make up a nice tiffin for us Simpson. Everything
of the best. Put in a small bottle of champagne for
me. (<i>Pause.</i>) D&#8217;ye hear, Simpson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>who is standing behind, chokingly</i>). Yes,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Shall I drive Darling in the trap? We
can take Simpson with us, and he can bring it back
and then fetch us about four or five, eh, sweetheart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>smiles and nods</i>). Lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>still going on with his breakfast</i>). Did you
hear that, Simpson? Go out and tell the boy to
have the trap ready by&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Looks at his watch,
and then turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>.) Shall we say eleven
o&#8217;clock, sweetheart? It&#8217;s ten now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Yes, dear, that will do beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Eleven o&#8217;clock, Simpson. Tell him to be
here at eleven; and I shall want you to come with
us and bring the trap back. (<i>Pause</i>; <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>shows
signs of distress</i>.) Simpson, did you hear what I said?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
(<i>Turns round and sees</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson&#8217;s</span> <i>face</i>.) What&#8217;s the
matter, man? Aren&#8217;t you well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>licks his lips</i>). Well, sir&mdash; (<i>swallows</i>)
the fact is, sir, I don&#8217;t feel up to much this morning,
sir. (<i>Wipes his face.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Jack, dear, I don&#8217;t think he can be well.
He was like that when I came down, and I had to
give him some brandy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>wheeling round in his chair</i>). Brandy!
Simpson, what do you want brandy for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> It&#8217;s just a touch of faintness, sir, I
think&mdash;I think&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> You think? Are you sure you&#8217;ve not
been drinking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> No, sir, no, really.... I&#8217;m all right,
now, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Well, you don&#8217;t look it. But the drive
will put you right. You run out and tell the boy to
bring the trap here by eleven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson.</span> Yes, sir. (<span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>goes out half-dazed,
and</i> <span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>sits down again</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>in a tone of sympathy to</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>). I know
what it is, darling. He&#8217;s fretting about me and the
ship. Of course I know he thinks I&#8217;m a wonderful
sailor and that I&#8217;m cut out for an admiral, and that
nobody&#8217;s worth knowing who isn&#8217;t in the Navy;
but he&#8217;ll soon get over that once we&#8217;re at Singapore
and get to work on our little schooner. By Jove,
pettling, we shall have to show what we can do as
sailors then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> But I shall be with you, and we shall
be so happy, and I am so proud of you, Jack&mdash;my
Jack!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> And I am proud of you.... Why&mdash;you&#8217;ve
got a new dress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>nods her head, and looks at him quizzically</i>).
And you hadn&#8217;t noticed it before? Mother gave it
to me for my birthday. Do you like it? (<i>She slips

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> It&#8217;s a vision, darling, a vision of delight.
But I want to hold you; come here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>she trips back to him, and leaning her face

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> So am I. So happy that it seems like a
beautiful dream. I sometimes have to stop and
shake myself to make sure that I&#8217;m not lying in that
stuffy old bunk of mine on the Leviathon. But
it&#8217;s no dream. It&#8217;s a wonderful, beautiful reality&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Yes, it is wonderful. I am a lucky girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> And I&#8217;m a lucky boy, and we&#8217;ll say that
every day for years and years and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> We&#8217;ll never get tired?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (in a hard voice). Mr. Maitland! (<span class="smcap">Jack</span>
<i>makes no reply, and</i> <span class="smcap">Belson</span> <i>comes half way towards
them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>hoarsely</i>). What do you want&mdash;sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>sternly</i>). I want you. (<span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> <i>clutches
at</i> <span class="smcap">Jack&#8217;s</span> <i>arm</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> I&#8217;m not going back! I&#8217;ve sent in my
resignation. I&#8217;m going to stay here&mdash;with my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Then you&#8217;re already married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> No, but we shall be&mdash;on Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Maitland, the Captain&#8217;s orders are that
you come back with me to the ship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> I&#8217;m sorry, sir, but I can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;ve
made up my mind to leave the Navy. (<i>Suddenly.</i>)
But how did you know I was here? How could
you know? (<i>Sees</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>standing just inside the
door with a hang-dog look</i>.) (<i>Pointing at him.</i>) By
heaven, a traitor! (<i>Shakes off</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> <i>and strides
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Simpson</span>, <i>but</i> <span class="smcap">Belson</span> <i>gets between them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Maitland, don&#8217;t forget that you are still
a naval officer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Traitor! This is what you call loyalty to
a master who gave you his confidence, was ready to
make a friend of you, and would make you independent
of everything and everybody! In return you
play the low-down sneak. You betray me and try
to wreck my happiness and my life. But you&#8217;ve
failed! Get out, you filthy viper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> (<i>holding out his hands imploringly</i>). I
did it for your sake, sir. I thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>furiously</i>). Get out, or by&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>stepping forward and holding up a hand
to stop him</i>). The man did quite right&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> He didn&#8217;t. He promised to stand by me,
and he&#8217;s sold me. But I won&#8217;t come back. You
can&#8217;t make me. I refuse. I&#8217;m my own master.
I&#8217;ve sent in my resignation and they can take it or
be damned to them! (<i>Turns towards</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> <i>who
nestles up to him. He turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Belson</span>.) Mr. Belson,
is there any need to prolong&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Will you introduce me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>hesitates, and then presents</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>). Madamoiselle
Ometsu San&mdash;Lieut.-Commander Belson.
(<i>They bow stiffly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>gravely</i>). Mam&#8217;zelle, would you permit
me to have a few minutes with Mr. Maitland
alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>quickly</i>). No&mdash;no&mdash;I refuse. Don&#8217;t go,
sweetheart! I&#8217;m very sorry, sir, but I can&#8217;t go.
I have finished with the Navy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>). Mam&#8217;zelle, do you know
that Mr. Maitland has been ten years in the British
Navy? (<i>She bows.</i>) Do you know that if he resigns
his commission he will never be able to get back?
(<i>She remains silent.</i>) Do you know&mdash;pardon me&mdash;but
do you know that if you marry him he will not
be able to go back to England?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Oh, yes, I can! But I shan&#8217;t want to. We
are going away to live our own lives&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> You mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Yes, I mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span>&mdash;that you&#8217;re going to be a voluntary
outcast&mdash;a vagabond&mdash;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter to you what I do so
long as I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Yes, it does. You belong to an honourable
profession and you are trying to leave it dishonourably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>hotly</i>). No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;ve sent in my
papers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Which will not be accepted. Mam&#8217;zelle,
do you think that your father would have treated
the Japanese Navy as Mr. Maitland proposes to treat
the British?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> That&#8217;s nothing to do with it. There&#8217;s no
war on. You only want to take me home to England.
I don&#8217;t want to go&mdash;I <i>won&#8217;t</i> go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Mam&#8217;zelle, do you think that your
brother would act like this? Would you respect
him if he did? And believe me&mdash;I say it with all
deference&mdash;&#8220;East is East and West is West.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>hoarsely</i>). No, it is not so! And if it is,
Ometsu and I will run the risk. (<i>He looks down at
her, but she stands like a statue.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> You wouldn&#8217;t like your brother to marry
Maitland&#8217;s sister in England, and then sail away
out of your lives. His mother is a widow. Who is
going to look after her and her affairs when she grows
old? (<i>Pause.</i>) Apart from that, do you think
that he will be happy knowing that he has deserted
the Navy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Grrrrrrrrh! There are plenty more without
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> No country can afford to lose good men.
And you will be lost, Maitland&mdash;<i>lost</i>&mdash;if you carry
out this mad project&mdash;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Very well, let me be mad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Belson</span> <i>in a strained voice</i>). Do you
really believe that if I married Jack I should spoil
his life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>in agony</i>). Ometsu! Don&#8217;t think of such
a thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu</span> (<i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Belson</span>, <i>and he bows in the affirmative.
She continues, in the same strained voice</i>). I
remember now that during the war the women were
called on to sacrifice themselves. Jack, if you
don&#8217;t go back your country will lose one man&mdash;one
good man. Who knows, dear, that one day, years
to come, you may be the one man who might save
your country! Ought we to run that risk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> But, darling, that is too preposterous&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> No, dear, it isn&#8217;t. No one can tell who
will be the saviour of his country. Jack, darling,
we must think of that. We must&mdash;I must&mdash;think
of what ought to be done for love of country....
You will have to go&mdash;Jack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Ometsu! You are not&mdash;you are not
afraid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson.</span> Afraid! Maitland, she is a daughter
of Japan! You are a son of England! <i>She</i> sees&mdash;<i>she</i>
knows&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> She doesn&#8217;t! Ometsu!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Yes, I do, Jack; <i>dear</i> Jack! You
must go back&mdash;it was a mistake. (<i>She tries to draw
away from him, but he holds her by her wrists.</i>) You
must go, Jack. And if you come back&mdash;I&#8217;ll wait.
I&mdash;I shan&#8217;t forget&mdash;dear heart!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> But&mdash;Ometsu!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Jack, dear, we had forgotten&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
are greater claims than that of love. Your <i>country</i>
wants you. It has a greater claim on you than
I.... Don&#8217;t make it too hard for me.... You
know that you ought to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belson</span> (<i>almost sharply</i>). Maitland, show her that
you are a man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> (<i>holds out his arms, she comes to him</i>). You
believe it the right thing to do, Ometsu?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ometsu.</span> Yes, dear&mdash;and I will wait&mdash;and wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> And I will come back&mdash;you shall <i>be</i> my
wife! (<i>He bends down and kisses her.</i> <span class="smcap">Belson</span>
<i>comes forward and takes his arm, and gently draws him
away</i>. <span class="smcap">Belson</span> <i>turns quickly to</i> <span class="smcap">Ometsu</span>, <i>takes her
hand and kisses it almost reverently. Then he leads</i>
